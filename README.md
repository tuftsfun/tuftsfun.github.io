# FUN in the Afternoon Homepage
This repository hosts the homepage for FUN in the Afternoon.

## Updating the website
The `style.css` and `yarn.lock` files are autogenerated and 
should not be manually modified. If you need to change the 
website's stylesheet, edit `scss/style.scss` (you can use 
SASS).

## Deploy instructions
This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. To deploy an update, 
simply commit your change and push. However, before you push:
* make sure all JS modules are up to date by running `yarn install`;
* run the `predeploy.sh` script, which will compile the SASS stylesheets 
  to plain CSS;
* add your changes, check for conflicts and commit them if there are no 
  conflicts. If there are conflicts, contact Ray.
